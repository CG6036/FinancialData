## Summary
Despite the availability of diverse datasets and continuous research into new investment strategies, predicting stock market movements remains challenging due to high volatility and numerous influencing factors. Many stocks are significantly affected by unpredictable fluctuations, such as economic and political factors, leading to sharp increases and declines that pose difficulties for investors. To address this issue, numerous researchers have attempted to predict stock performance based on data analysis. From the perspective of investors who require accurate predictions, stock performance prediction based on data analysis is an effective and essential means of reducing investment risk.

This study proposes a stock performance prediction model that combines the traditional investment strategy of the "Magic Formula" with machine learning techniques. Using six algorithms, the model was trained on 10 years of data from 82 Korean stocks, followed by comparative analysis experiments. The results demonstrated that the Gaussian Process Classification model, which had not been widely highlighted in prior research, achieved the highest performance, proving to be an effective tool for predictive studies. This finding broadens the scope of research in stock performance prediction, adding significant value to the field.
